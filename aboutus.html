    <p><small>Learn Well Institute was created in 1992 by the vision and toil of Mr. Vivek Chauhan, a Computer Engineering Graduate from Chandigarh university. We had a very humble beginning as a forum for learning computer sciences, with a vision to provide an ideal launch pad for serious software engineering aspirants.Along the way to realization of this vision, we went beyond merely coaching for computer based languages.</small></p>
    <p><strong>Today, aiming for the unachievable and continuously raising the bar has become a part of the LEARN WELL DNA .</strong></p>
